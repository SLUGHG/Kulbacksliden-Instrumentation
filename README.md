# Kulbacksliden-Instrumentation

This project is a simple export of a QGIS project using qgis2web plugin.

This repository is just for making it available as a github page, with the possibility to zoom in-out and look closer at the instrumentation

# Editing the project

Editing the project will require opening it in qgis, with all the shapefiles and editing it if need will be. For that reason, I have put all necessary shapefiles in
the folder /shapefiles within the repository. In the same folder you can also find the qgz file; Opening the qgiz file (after download of the repository ofcourse) in qgis, and setting the path to the shapefiles
will make it possible to get the same symbologies.

Most likely, you might have problems with the svg markers I used not being available to you. They are stored in the folder /marker within the repository.

Get in touch if anything!

# General about gh-pages

In order to have the github page, you need to create a branch named "gh-pages" from the master branch. And your repository will be accessible at https://username.github.io/reponame
